<h2>Get the Watermelon</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A polish of my first Digital-Template, where two players compete against each other
in a no-holds barred race to get a watermelon.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to have in this game polish a sense of extreme competition and mischief.
I want them to have fun messing with the other player.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
2-Player Meta-game race.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The actions either player can choose is to move up, down, left, and right. Unlike my
Digital-Template-1 this game's objective is not to catch the other player, rather it's
to be the first to get the watermelon. Each player is allowed to do as much as they want
to hinder the other. This includes blocking the path with their character, pushing the other
character out of the way, and prohibiting the other player from interacting with the computer
via out-of-game hinderance.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Incorporating non-digital elements within a digital game.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The features that set this game apart are the inclusion of non-digital gameplay elements
integrated into digital gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Unlike the first game, there is no real setting or premise. You're simply a dog and a person,
each willing to do whatever it takes to capture a watermelon.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
(None)
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
My target audience are those who like to mess with other players, and those who are highly
competitive.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
It's dependent on how much the players hinder each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Strategies I expect to see are:
1. Stop the other player from touching the keyboard.
2. Blocking the path so no forward movement can be made.
3. Messing with other players controls.
4. Pushing the other player away from the goal.
</li>
