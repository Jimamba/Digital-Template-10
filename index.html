<h2>Catch the Dog</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A two-player tag-like experience, where one player the dog-catcher must catch the
dog (doge)
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to have pure simplistic fun, while providing a somewhat fair
experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Electronic tag.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The actions either player can choose is to move up, down, left, and right.The object of the
game being that one player is the dog catcher and they must capture the other player (the dog).
The dog catcher uses the WASD keys to move, while the dog uses the arrow keys. The game ends
when the dog is caught.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Multiplayer.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The features that set this game apart are the multiplayer functionality and the oddly simple,
yet joyful simulation of tag.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game's setting is incredibly simplistic. The setting is nowhere special, and for simplicities sake
it takes place in a grassy field of sorts.The backstory is that one player is a dog-catcher doing their job,
while the other player is a dog that really doesn't want to be caught.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
(None)
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
My target audience are those who play more casually with a friend.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
It's dependent on the skill of the players.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Strategies I expect to see are:
1. Keep the other dog-catcher as diagonally far away as possible.
2. Sabotage outside of the game due to close proximity
3. Mind Games.
</li>
